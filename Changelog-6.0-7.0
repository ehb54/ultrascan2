Changelog for version 6.x (BF = Bug Fix, NF = New Feature, UD = Update, DC = Documentation):

BF us_equilspeed.cpp: rpm calculation was off by a factor of 2, corrected.

BF us_equilsim.cpp: equilibrium simulation routine displayed incorrect association constant
   to dissociation constant conversion.

BF us_dtactrl.cpp: fixed cell information display bug when data was excluded and smoothing 
   applied subsequently.

BF us_equilsim.cpp: fixed error when exporting single step concentration and speed.

NF us_combine.cpp: Added capability to do molecular weight transformations from S20,W
   distributions

BF us_globalequil.cpp: doubleclicking on the only scan in the scan listbox caused
   a crash - fixed.

BF us_globalequil.cpp: program now forces loading of fit before allowing
   a Monte Carlo analysis

BF us_archive.cpp: program failed to include ln(C) vs r^2 data files in
   EQ-project generation

NF us_minimize.cpp, us_globalequil.cpp, us_equilmc_t.cpp,
   us_finite_ad.cpp, us_minimize.h us_eqfitter.cpp, us_extinctfitter.cpp:
   included an automatic convergence optimization, program now can
   automatically switch between different nonlinear least squares
   optimization algorithms to further refine the fit.

BF us_globalequil.cpp: UltraScan now returns the appropriate error message when a fit
   from the incorrect result directory is loaded.

NF	us_matrix.cpp, us_thread.cpp: threading can now be selected at compile time for
   global fitting calculations of A'A calculations for the information matrix.

BF us_minimize.cpp: Fixed unhandled condition in linesearch for Quasi-Newton

BF us_db_expdata.cpp: Wavelength data was not deposited in database
   because of filename mismatch, filename corrected from "[Ww]i*" to "[Ww]a".

NF us_rundetails.cpp: directory and run name labels changed to readonly
   lineedits to allow copy/paste and viewing long strings

UD Maintenance Release: UltraScan 6.0.1

NF us_combine.cpp: run ID labels changed to readonly lineedits to allow
   copy/paste and viewing long strings

BF	us_globalequil.cpp: fixed scan counter range on main page

NF us_globalequil.cpp, us_eqfitter.cpp, us_selectmodel.cpp: added hetero-
   associating A+B <=> AB model for equilibrium fits.

BF us_extinction.cpp: wavelength component initialization for fit is
	now equally spaced out over the entire wavelength range

BF us_eqfitter.cpp: fixed crashing problem when fitting Fixed Molecular 
	Weight distribution.

NF	us_eqfitter.cpp, us_math.cpp, us_globalequil.cpp: Added nonnegatively
	constrained least squares fitting algorithm for calculating equilibrium derived
	continuous distributions. 

NF us_equiltime.cpp: Added equilibrium time predictor for estimating time
	to equilibrium for different channels and speeds.

BF us_editor.cpp: fixed loading bug

BF us_equilmodelctrl.cpp: fixed crashing bug when canceling out of loading of 
	extinction data

NF us_vhwsim.cpp: added s-value histogram plot and data

NF us_velocreport.cpp: added s-value histogram plot and data to html reports

BF us_eqfitter.cpp: Fixed bug where residuals/raw data/fitted data ASCII data
   were never printed to a dat file.

NF us_config.cpp: Directory and file paths are now selectable with a dialog

NF us_equilreport.cpp: Added link for ASCII data file spreadsheets for plotting
   experimental data, fitted overlays and residuals

NF us_vhwsim.cpp: Added histogram and histogram envelope plotting as well as 
   controls to select smoothing of the envelope and the sensitivity of the 
   histogram, added documentation.

NF us_eqfitter.cpp Added an average concentration per datapoint. This number is
   the weighted average concentration from the concentration histogram for each
   point in the fit.

UD us_beowulf.cpp: Changed the default location for the Beowulf node definition
   file to the root directory, so each user can dynamically allocate a different
   node profile without root permission.

NF us_vhwenhanced.cpp: added plotting of the diffusion line cutoff to the edited
   data plot.

NF us_simdlg.cpp: added ability to import s, D directly from modeling dialog and
   to select the appropriate model shape (sphere, oblate, rod, etc...)

NF us_merge.cpp: added wavelength file merging to utility

BF us_diagnostics: fixed failure to read certain interference files

NF us_dtactrl.cpp, us_combine.cpp: Added user-selected fonts to the plot
   interfaces.

UD documentation updates

BF us_combine.cpp: adjusted the way the x-scale limits are determined - different
	ranges for MW distributions and S-value distributions

BF us_win.cpp: correctly eliminate /proc file system utilities from non-linux
   platforms.

BF us_edvint.cpp: Improved algorithm to detect and compensate for 
   integral fringe jumps during editing.

BF us_dtctrl.cpp: Fixed automatic hydrodynamic correction when multiple
   cells have different buffers, and when buffers are loaded from DB, and 
   when "reset" button was clicked.

NF us_editor.cpp: Added richtext editing controls to editor

BF us_globalequil.cpp: fixed scan cropping utility which would only work
   correctly if left limit was defined first, now either limit can be defined
   and order doesn't matter anymore.

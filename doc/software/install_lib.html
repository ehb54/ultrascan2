Installation Instructions - Library Dependencies
</h2>
<p align=justify>
<b><i>UltraScan</b></i> requires a number of libraries that are dynamically
linked to the executables in the UltraScan software package. Normally, these
libraries are installed by default on the system. However, some libraries
may not be available in the correct format (certain required options may have
been excluded during compilation), or may be altogether missing. For the
convenience of the <b><i>UltraScan</b></i> user we offer precompiled
versions of the libraries on the download page.
</ul>
<p>
<p align=justify>
To install the libraries, download the needed library file(s) and extract them
in a directory that is included in your dynamic link path (/usr/lib, or /usr/local/lib, 
for example), then run <b>"ldconfig"</b> to reload the dynamically shared library table. 
Here, </b>"/path"</b> refers to the path to your downloaded library tar.gz file, and it 
is assumed that you want to extract the files to <b>"/usr/lib/."</b>:
<pre>
cd /usr
tar -xvzf /path/qt-version-distribution.tar.gz
ldconfig
</pre>
<p>
This will also install all needed dynamic links, and extract to /usr/lib. When extracting
the qt libraries to a specific directory such as /usr/lib/qt/lib, change directory to 
/usr/lib/qt instead.
<p align=justify>
<b>Note:</b><br>
When installing qt or qwt libraries please make sure that older versions of the library
are not laying around that may conflict with the newer version.

Installation Instructions - WIN32 package for any Microsoft platform:
</h2>
<p>
To install the Windows package please follow these steps:
<p>
Download the windows version of UltraScan and save it on your
harddrive in a temporary directory (for example, c:\tmp). After
downloading, click on the downloaded file from your file manager and you
will be prompted with a location for the installation.  Here you want
to enter c:\program files\UltraScan. After all files are extracted,
you are ready to apply for an UltraScan license file, which should be
installed in c:\program files\UltraScan\etc\uslicense. You can register
your download <a href=http://www.ultrascan.uthscsa.edu>here</a>.
<p>
The Autoinstaller will set all environment variables and contains all
necessary libraries. If you want to run UltraScan with the database
support, please review the <a href=../manual/win target=_blank>
installation instructions for MySQL</a>.

<p>
<b><font color=red>NOTE for Non-US Windows Installations:</font></b>
<p>
If you install UltraScan on a Windows computer using a non-US Windows 
distribution, the file system layout may need some modification before
UltraScan will correctly install. The US version of Windows has a directory
called <b>"C:\Program Files\"</b>, which UltraScan expects to be present.
It has come to my attention that for example German Windows installations
do not have this directory and instead have one called <b>"C:\Programme\"</b>.
UltraScan has not yet learned to understand German, so the only way to get
this working on your foreign system is to recreate the directory <b>"C:\Program Files\"</b>
on your system and to install UltraScan into that directory instead of
the default Program directory on your system.

<h2 align=left>Diagnostics - Concentration Dependency of <i>S</i></h2>
Concentration dependency of <i>S</i> is often observed for large, 
non-globular, and charged molecules. Typical examples include virus
particles and linear DNA molecules, especially when analyzed in low 
salt buffers. Such molecules tend to interact significantly under
high concentration transport conditions and behave non-ideally during
sedimentation. The amount of interaction increases with increasing
concentration and always causes a reduction of <i>S</i>. A first-order
approximation of the concentration dependency is given by:

<p>
<i>s<sub>k</sub> = s<sub>0</sub> (1 - sigma<sub>k</sub> C<sub>k</sub>) </i>
<p>
</center>
The slowing down of sedimentation at higher concentration can be 
compared to travelling on a congested freeway - the higher the 
density of molecules the slower they will proceed due to bumping and
jostling into adjacent molecules which slows down the transport.
A plot of a simulated velocity experiment with and without concentration
dependency is shown below:

<b>Figure 12:</b> Single-component system simulated with the finite element
method. <br>
Parameters: sedimentation coefficient: 
8.0 x 10<sup>-13</sup> seconds, diffusion coefficient: 
2.0 x 10<sup>-7</sup> cm<sup>2</sup>/sec, relative loading concentration: 
1.0, Speed: 45,000 rpm, scan spacing: 10 minutes, with 20 minute initial
delay.
<p>
It is clear to see that the higher the concentration, the slower the 
molecules will move. This effect will become more obvious at later scans,
causing a larger difference between sample with and without concentration
dependency. Thus, for a single component, non-ideal system, the boundary 
fractions corresponding to the higher concentration will extrapolate to
a <i>slower S</i> value than those corresponding to lower concentration, 
giving rise to the characteristic cross-over effect:

(with 30 scans) with concentration dependency. Note the crossing-over point
indicative of concentration dependency of <i>S</i>.

slope indicative of concentration dependency of <i>S</i>.
<p>
For strongly concentration dependent samples, another diagnostic results 
from the fact that radial dilution changes the concentration dependency
effect of <i>S</i> throughout the run, which is most notable in the 
upper boundary divisions:

<center>

</center>
<p>
<b>Figure 15:</b> strongly concentration dependent sample. Note the arc
that best fits the top boundary divisions. This is caused by radial dilution.
<p>
<b>Possible Mis-Interpretations:</b><br>
There is one instance where concentration dependent data could be 
misinterpreted: If both heterogeneity <i>and</i> concentration dependency
of <i>S</i> are present, the positive slope in the distribution plot caused
by heterogeneity could be cancelled by the negative slope effect from the
concentration dependency. In such a case running multiple concentrations
of the same sample is necessary (which is always a good practice - regardless)
since it will unambigously indicate that the distributions change, if 
concentration dependency is present. This is demonstrated in the plot 
below:
<p>
<center>
<img src=conc_dep4.gif>
</center>
<p>
<b>Figure 16:</b> 6-component system with concentration dependency at
three different concentrations - Note that the distributions change when
the concentration is changed, indicating concentration dependency of
<i>S</i> for a heterogeneous system. The two effects cancel each other
and therefore a global measurement over several concentrations is always
recommended to identify this condition. As a side note, it should be
remarked that a self-associating system cannot be confused with this type
of concentration dependency, since increasing the concentration will (by
mass action) generally <i>increase</i> the sedimentation coefficient since
the average molecular weight increases due to polymerization at higher
concentration. This is true for reversible and irreversible associations.
In some rare cases the self-associating system may produce very concentration
dependent polymers (maybe due to end-to-end association which can cause
considerable concentration dependency of <i>S</i> due to the asymmetric 
shape of the resulting molecule). In such cases the concentration 
dependency/self-association behaviour may be difficult to separate.
<p>
Another misinterpretation of extrapolation plots that show crossing-over
can result when the crossing-over is not caused by concentration dependency
of <i>S</i>, but rather by the loss of material, such as may be present in  
aggregating samples (please see the <a href=aggregation.html>next</a> section
for additional details).

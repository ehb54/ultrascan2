<h2 align=left>Calculation of apparent Sedimentation Coefficients</i></h2>
<p>
The first step in distinguishing diffusional boundary spreading from
spreading due to heterogeneity in <i>S</i> is to calculate <i>apparent
sedimentation coefficients</i>, <i>s*</i>, along the entire boundary.
First, the boundary is divided into equally spaced horizontal 
boundary fractions between the baseline and the plateau. 
The intercepts of these divisions are located and mapped on the 
boundary as shown below:

<b>Figure 4:</b> In this plot, 11 equally spaced boundary fractions between 
the plateau concentration and the baseline absorbance have been mapped onto
a single scan; the corresponding radial positions in the boundary 
(r<sub>b</sub>) are identified r<sub>1</sub> through r<sub>11</sub>.
For clarity, only 11 divisions are shown, in practice, the number 
of divisions is often larger (50-100).
<p>
The known time of the scan and the radial positions associated with the
intercepts (r<sub>1</sub> - r<sub>11</sub>) are then used to calculate
an apparent <i>S</i>-value, <i>s<sub>b</sub>*</i>, for each boundary
position:

<p>
Here, <i>r<sub>b</sub></i> refers to the radial position of the boundary 
fraction intercept, <i>r<sub>m</sub></i> refers to the meniscus position,
<i>t</i> is the corrected time of the scan, and <i>t<sub>0</sub></i> is the
start time of the experiment, corrected for rotor acceleration. The rotor
acceleration time correction can be determined by taking the omega-square-t
integral times from scans taken at constant velocity and plotting them against
the actual time of the scan. Extrapolating to zero omega-square-t will 
reveal the rotor acceleration time difference, which needs to be subtracted
from the times recorded for all scans.
<p>
This procedure is repeated for each scan in the experiment. Because of 
radial dilution, the absolute spacing between the boundary fractions 
will decrease over time, since the plateau absorbance decreases. This
gives rise to the same number of apparent <i>S</i>-values, <i>s*</i>, 
for each scan in the experiment. It is clear from this algorithm that
only scans that span the entire range from baseline to plateau concentration
can be included in a global fit.

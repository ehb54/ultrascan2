<h2 align=left>Introduction</i></h2>
<p>
In recent years analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) has gained
considerable recognition as an important technique employed in
biochemical laboratories for the physical characterization of biological
macromolecules and macromolecular assemblies in solution.  With the
advent of the Beckman Optima XL-A and XL-I analytical ultracentrifuges,
accuracy, resolution, reliability and reproducibility of experimental
results have increased significantly.
<p>
This increase in quality of experimental data has motivated many 
researchers to tackle more complex biological systems which
often involve multiple components and interactions between them. When 
dealing with systems that contain more than one solute it is important
that one is able to differentiate between these components and is able
to identify them correctly.
<p>
Oftentimes, the researcher deals with systems of unknown composition
and the number of the individual components and their properties are
not known.
In such cases, data from sedimentation velocity experiments can be
used successfully to identify heterogeneity in molecular weight or
frictional properties by analyzing this data with the van Holde - 
Weischet method.

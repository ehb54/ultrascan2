<h2 align=left>Aggregation</i></h2>
<p>
In some cases samples tend to aggregate by forming reversible or irreversible
polymer units. Oftentimes, this aggregation is concentration dependent, and
reversibility can be asserted by simply diluting the sample and running it 
again. Isodesmic associations cause sometimes indefinite self-associations,
each successive multimer associating with a similar association constant as
the previous step. Such cases will result in mixtures of different multimers 
in solution which may have very different sedimentation properties.
<p>
Such aggregation can easily be detected by running a sedimentation velocity
experiment, since it will result in a characteristic van Holde - Weischet
extrapolation plot, that shows both loss of material and great heterogeneity.
Oftentimes, the slower sedimenting components are present in higher
concentration. Shown below is a velocity experiment of a typical isodesmically
self-associating system.

<b>Figure 23:</b> Isodesmically associating system. Scans drawn in red do 
not have a
stable plateau and should not be included in the analysis. Due to the great 
range of <i>S</i>-values present, it is often difficult to select a speed that
allows proper analysis of <i>all</i> components in the system at the same time.

<b>Figure 24:</b>van Holde - Weischet analysis of data including scans drawn
in red. The extrapolation plot clearly shows a diagnostic identifying
the scans that should be excluded from the analysis. In addition, 
heterogeneity in <i>S</i> is clearly apparent. All scans which do
not have a stable plateau display the loss of material in the upper
boundary fractions and cause poor correlation in the linear fits. The
extrapolation lines cross over similar to concentration dependent samples,
however, after excluding inappropriate scans, the data reverts to nearly
perfect correlation (see below).

<b>Figure 25:</b> van Holde - Weischet analysis of data excluding scans drawn
in red. The extrapolation plot shows a good correlation for all scans
across the entire boundary and identifies a large range of <i>S</i> values
in the sample.

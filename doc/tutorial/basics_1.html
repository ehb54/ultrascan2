<h2 align=left>The Basics</i></h2>
<p>
While in earlier years researchers had to rely on Model-E type
instrumentation, which imposed certain limitations on the quality of the
results, data analysis methods focused mainly on the characterization
of simple ideal, single component systems. Standard methods employed
generally were restricted to calculations of the second moment point,
calculations of peak positions in Schlieren data, or transformations of
data to derivative space to obtain peaks similar to Schlieren data.

<p>
A major disadvantage of these methods was that these methods would generally
not provide any information on possible heterogeneity unless individual 
components were well resolved. This problem results from the
boundary spreading of diffusion which is superimposed on the boundary
spreading due to sedimentation transport. In the worst-case scenario,
heterogeneity itself follows a gaussian distribution, making it virtually
impossible to tell apart from the gaussian spreading of the boundary
due to diffusion. Similarly, small differences in <i>S</i> due to 
conformational isomers can often be buried under the much larger diffusion
signal. In such cases individual boundaries may be virtually identical 
in shape to boundaries from single component system which simply have a 
larger diffusion coefficient.
<p>
In such cases it is only possible to tell these systems apart, if the 
boundaries for the entire time course of the sedimentation velocity experiment
are considered in a global analysis. K. van Holde and W. Weischet in 1979
realized that sedimentation and diffusion are separable processes
of transport, since they proceed with different orders of magnitude.
While sedimentation is a transport process proportional to the first 
power of time, diffusion proceeds with a velocity proportional
to the square-root of time. Thus, if allowed to sediment for an infinite
time in an infinitely long cell at sufficient acceleration, the diffusion 
spreading observed would only be local to the boundary of that component
and all components would be well resolved. 
<p>
Assuming that the sedimentation velocity of each component in the system
stays constant throughout the sedimentation process (which is not always
the case), plotting the apparent sedimentation coefficients (derived
from the radial positions of corresponding positions in the boundary)
against the square-root of the time of each scan, and extrapolating
the corresponding apparent sedimentation coefficients to infinite time
provides then the true S-value distribution of the system, corrected
for diffusion.
<p>
<b>Summary:<br>
<blockquote>
The <i>only</i> analysis method capable of unambigously
distinguishing between heterogeneity and homogeneity in <i>S</i> is 
the van Holde - Weischet
analysis, and thus it is an indispensable tool for the characterization
of unknown samples or samples of known heterogeneity. In addition,
the van Holde - Weischet analysis provides many important and useful
diagnostics, which will be highlighted later in this tutorial.</b>

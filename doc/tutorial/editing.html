<p>
The van Holde - Weischet analysis is based on a solution of the Lamm
equation which assumes an infinitely long cell. This solution does not
consider the exisiting boundary conditions, the meniscus and the bottom of
the cell. In an infinitely long cell, material never pellets. In addition,
in an infinitely long cell there will never be any back-diffusion
from the bottom of the cell.  Both pelleting and back-diffusion occurs
because material accumulates at the bottom of the cell.  Since these
boundary conditions are not considered in the solution of the Lamm
equation employed by the van Holde- Weischet analysis, all data scans
that contain absorption profiles resulting from boundary effects will
distort the solution.
<p>
Thus, all data included in the van Holde - Weischet analysis needs to
be free of boundary effects. Therefore, you need to exclude any data
containing boundary effects during editing or at runtime.  Another
requirement is that all scans included in the data analysis represent
the <b>same</b> chemical composition of the sample(s) contained in the
system. This is very important because the analysis attempts a global
fit including all data in the extrapolation to infinite time. If the
scans included in the analysis represent different compositions (for
example, time dependent aggregation or degradation), the extrapolations
will be misleading, although some diagnostic indicator can usually be
obtained for such cases from the van Holde - Weischet extrapolation plot
(please see the section on <a href="diagnostics.html">diagnostics</a>
for more information on indicators and analysis complications).

<P>
The following
section explores which scans can be included in the analysis and which 
scans should be excluded.

<b>Figure 10:</b>This figure shows a heterogeneous system of scans,
outlined in 3 different colors. Only scans outlined in blue should 
be included in the analysis.
<P>
<ul>
<li> The yellow scans did not clear the meniscus and do not exhibit
the necessary baseline. A minimal section of baseline is required for
analysis to assure that the full concentration range C<sub>baseline</sub>
to C<sub>plateau</sub> is available for the divisions.  Therefore,
the yellow lines need to be excluded from the analysis.
<P> 
<li>Scans outlined in pink can also not be included in the analysis,
because they do not contain the necessary stable (horizontal) plateau
to provide the full concentration range. The sample sedimenting at the
very top of the boundary is already precipitated in those scans and
the plateau therefore is lower than what would be expected by radial
dilution alone. If the pink scans would be included, the composition of
the sample would be different in the earlier scans from the composition
in the later scans, and respective boundary fractions would not correspond
to eachother and the extrapolations would be misleading.
</ul>

<P>
<b>Figure 11:</b>The scans shown below are appropriate for inclusion in
the van Holde - Weischet analysis since they meet all necessary criteria,
such as baseline and stable plateau.
<P>
Please consider the following points when selecting the baseline and 
plateau region: <P>
<ul>
<li>The baseline is easiest determined by averaging a small stretch of datapoints
near the meniscus from the last scan in the dataset (it has the moving boundary
closest to the bottom of the cell and thus a good baseline).
<li>The plateau is best determined by averaging a few datapoints near the 
bottom of the cell where the moving boundary has levelled out to form a 
plateau. This plateau region shown in the above plot is an appropriate
range to be used for plateau determination. All scans have levelled out
in this region. If a large amount of heterogeneity exists, or large 
of diffusion, this region may be very short. To average several points
from the plateau region only use points from a truly horizontal region.
</ul>
<p>
The UltraScan software will guide you during editing to define these points
and automatically averages the points.
<p>
<b>Speed Selection:</b><p>
Attempt to select a speed as fast as possible with
the shortest intervals between scans, such that the boundary transverses 
approximately 2/3 of the cell with at least 15-20 scans. The faster the 
sample is spun, the less time it has to diffuse, and the more pronounced will 
be the difference between multiple components and the resolution of the 
analysis. Please review the section on <a href=design.html>experimental
design</a> for more information on optimal experimental setup.
<p>
<b>Summary:</b>
<ul>
<li>Do not include scans without a proper baseline (scans that haven't 
cleared the meniscus)
<li>Do not include scans that have a plateau lower than what would be 
expected from radial dilution alone.
<li>Select the plateau absorbance by averaging a few points near the bottom
of the cell where absorbance has levelled out
<li>If your sample is not at chemical equilibrium (in the process of aggregation
or degradation during the course of the experiment), the van Holde - Weischet 
extrapolations will be misleading 
</ul>

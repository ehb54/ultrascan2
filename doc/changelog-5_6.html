<font size=+1><b>
</b></font>
<p><b><font color=red>Bug Fix:</font></b><ul>

        as fit_ctrl.html)

</ul><p><b><font color=green>New Feature:</font></b><ul>
finite1.cpp: Eliminated positive constraint for S to allow for
        fitting of floating material.

</ul><p><b><font color=red>Bug Fix:</font></b><ul>
us_rundetails.cpp: fields for wavelengths/scans positions 2 and 3 were
not automatically blanked and reset, this is now fixed.

</ul><p><b><font color=green>New Feature:</font></b><ul>

program to allow user to determine more easily when equilibrium is
reached.
 
</ul><p><b><font color=green>New Feature:</font></b><ul>

</ul><p><b><font color=green>New Feature:</font></b><ul>
usglobalequil.cpp: Reworked initialization routine to provide a
        much improved initialization of fitting parameters by using a

</ul><p><b><font color=green>New Feature:</font></b><ul>
us_eqfitter.cpp: First stage fitting in multi-component self-
        associating models is not required for monomer-dimer association
        and has been eliminated because of improved monomer MW estimation
        during initialization.

us_config.cpp: Added width and hight dimensions of 6-channel centerpiece
sector dimensions. This will be used in the total mass integral
calculations in the global equilibrium fitting module.

</ul><p><b><font color=red>Bug Fix:</font></b><ul>

   scans can be selected even before the arrays are initialized.
   Adjusted the button logic accordingly.

</ul><p><b><font color=red>Bug Fix:</font></b><ul>
usglobalequil.cpp, us_eqfitter.cpp: if scan range is changed after

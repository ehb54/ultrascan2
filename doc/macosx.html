On some systems it has been reported that first-time installations of
Mac OSX versions of UltraScan may abort with a segmentation fault.

During initialization, UltraScan attempts to write a default configuration
file into the root of your home directory, called ~/.usrc, which contains
basic path information, font information, version information etc. If the
file does not exist yet, the program may crash during the bootstrap process
of creating the file that contains information UltraScan needs to run.
One way to get around this problem is to create this file beforehand. Simply
open a text editor and supply the following lines in the order shown,
then save the file in your home directory under the name "~/.usrc":

<h2>MySQL Database Installation</h2>
<p>
<i><b>UltraScan</b></i> supports an SQL database interface for managing the AUC data, such as 
experimental scans, buffer files, peptide files, investigator information, and so on. MySQL is an
open source, very capable database engine available for all hardware platforms, and has been
tested to perform well with <i><b>UltraScan</b></i>. Please follow these instructions to get MySQL properly 
initialized to work with <i><b>UltraScan</b></i> on your system:
<p>
<b>Getting MySQL onto your computer:</b> 
<p>
<ol>
<li>Most distributions of
Unix come with MySQL and therefore MySQL can be installed using the
respective package manager. For all other distributions, you can download
a source distribution and compile it on your system. More information
is available at <a href=http://www.mysql.com>http://www.mysql.com</a>.
<p>
<li>After successfully installing MySQL you will need to start the program
with the appropriate switches. The default start script does not allow for
sufficiently large file transfers between <i><b>UltraScan</b></i> and MySQL, and a special
option needs to be used to enable large file transfers. We have found the 
following command to work well for us:
<p>
<pre>
safe_mysqld --user=mysql -O key_buffer=16M -O \
table_cache=128 -O sort_buffer=4M -O record_buffer=1M -O max_allowed_packet=24M &
</pre>
<p>
<li>Now verify that MySQL is working properly by checking for the running mysql process
on your machine.
<p>
<li>Next, use the MySQL command line client to set up permissions for the database.
You start the client by typing as root at the commandline:
<p>
<pre>
systemprompt#:  mysql -u root
</pre>
<p>
<li>This should open up the <i>"mysql&gt;"</i> command shell. This is where you 
can enter the MySQL configuration commands:
<p>
<pre>
mysql>
</pre>
<p>
<li>Assuming you wanted to create a database called <b>"mydata"</b> on your 
MySQL server, you would have to type in the following commands:
<p>
<pre>
mysql> CREATE DATABASE mydata
mysql> quit
</pre>
<p>
<li>Now that the database is created, you need to set access permissions for
the users of the database. There are two ways to do that: First, you can assign
permissions for each existing user that should have access authorization, or second,
you can use a fictional user name everyone can use to connect to the database.
In the latter method, only a single user has to be configured in MySQL for access
permissions. Assuming you wanted to grant access rights to your <b>"mydata"</b>
database to user <b>"sqluser"</b> with password <b>"secret_word"</b> on your 
computer, which happens to be named <b>"mycomputer.private.net"</b>, you would 
have to enter the following commands into the <i>"mysql&gt;"</i> command shell:
<p>
<pre>
systemprompt#:  mysql -u root mydata
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO sqluser@mycomputer.private.net IDENTIFIED 
       BY 'secret_word' WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql> quit
</pre>
<p>
Repeat for each additional user for which you want to grant access. MySQL will
not use the system password, <b>"secret_word"</b> in this case will go with 
the database, not the user name.
<p>
<li>If you want to make the database accessible outside of your system, you can
grant access in the following way:
<p>
<pre>
systemprompt#:  mysql -u root mydata
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO user@"%" IDENTIFIED
       BY 'secret_word' WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql> quit
</pre>
<p>
<li>Now you need to tell <b><i>UltraScan</b></i> about the new database. You have to do 
that in the <a href=database_config.html>Database Configuration Module</a>, which is 
started from the <b>File:Configuration:Database Preferences</b> menu.
<p>
<li>Finally, you should run the <a href=database.html#initialize>Initialize Database Template</a>
command on your database to initialize the database tables. After initialization, MySQL should 
accept all new data via the UltraScan Database Interface.
</ol>
<p>
<b>PLATFORM SPECIFIC INFORMATION:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li><font size=+1><b>Linux/RedHat 9.0:</b></font> 
<p>
Check to see if you already have an older version of MySQL installed:
<br>
rpm -qa |grep MySQL
<p>

If you do, then remove each of them with:
<br>
rpm -e MySQL-something
<p>

Install these MySQL packages:
<br>
MySQL-client-4.0.18-0.i386.rpm
<br>
MySQL-server-4.0.18-0.i386.rpm
<br>
MySQL-devel-4.0.18-0.i386.rpm
<br>
MySQL-shared-4.0.18-0.i386.rpm
<br>
MySQL-Max-4.0.18-0.i386.rpm
<p>

At this address (scroll down to Linux x86 RPM downloads):
<a href=http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-4.0.html>http://www.mysql.com/downloads/mysql-4.0.html</a>
<p>

Create a file called /etc/my.cnf with these contents:
<p>
[mysqld]
<br>
port            = 3306
<br>
socket          = /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock
<br>
skip-locking
<br>
set-variable    = key_buffer=16M
<br>
set-variable    = max_allowed_packet=24M
<br>
set-variable    = thread_stack=64K
<br>
set-variable    = table_cache=128
<br>
set-variable    = sort_buffer=4M
<br>
set-variable    = net_buffer_length=2K
<br>
set-variable    = record_buffer=1M
<br>
server-id       = 1
<p>
_dir = /var/lib/mysql/
<br>
innodb_data_file_path = ibdata1:10M:autoextend
<br>
innodb_log_group_home_dir = /var/lib/mysql/
<br>
innodb_log_arch_dir = /var/lib/mysql/
<br>
# You can set .._buffer_pool_size up to 50 - 80 %
<br>
# of RAM but beware of setting memory usage too high
<br>
set-variable = innodb_buffer_pool_size=16M
<br>
set-variable = innodb_additional_mem_pool_size=2M
<br>
# Set .._log_file_size to 25 % of buffer pool size
<br>
set-variable = innodb_log_file_size=5M
<br>
set-variable = innodb_log_buffer_size=8M
<br>
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1
<br>
set-variable = innodb_lock_wait_timeout=50
<p>

Restart MySQL with:
<br>
/etc/init.d/mysql
<p>

Make MySQL start at boot time:
<br>
chkconfig mysql on
<p>

Change directory to /usr/lib/mysql. Now we need to make a shared library
<br>
with this command:
<p>

ld --whole-archive -shared -o libmysqlclient.so.11 libmysqlclient.a
<p>

Add /usr/lib/mysql to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig.
<p>

Now, the Qt plugin will work with your new install of MySQL.

<p>
<li><font size=+1><b>MIPS/Irix:</b></font> If you are using Irix Version 6.5.3 or newer mysqld will only be able to
create threads if you run it as a user with CAP_SCHED_MGT privileges (like
root) or give the mysqld server this privilege with the following shell
command:
<p>
<pre>
shell> chcap "CAP_SCHED_MGT+epi" /opt/mysql/libexec/mysqld
</pre>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> The mysql software may be installed in a different place on your computer
<p>
<li><font size=+1><b>Microsoft Windows:</b></font> Please check <a href=win/index.html>here</a> for detailed 
installation instructions for Windows
<p>
</ul>
<b>Security Configuration Notes:</b>
<p>
Please keep in mind the following security considerations:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Every database in MySQL requires the following authentication tokens:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the database
<li>The user name allowed to access the database
<li>The password for accessing the data (unless the user is "anonymous", in which case a
password is not required)
<li>The host name or IP address where the database is served from.
</ul>
<p>UltraScan provides these tokens to the MySQL database from the configuration files.
<p>
<li>If you permit other hosts and users to access the data on your
database there is nothing stopping them from reinitializing the entire
database with the default setup shown above. It is strongly recommended
to further restrict users from either intentionally or accidentally
deleting or initializing database records or the database itself. MySQL
provides very elaborate permission and access capabilities to customize
read/write/delete permissions for tables, records for individual
users. These settings can be set from the MySQL comandline or through a
third-party administration tool. For detailed information on this please
refer to the <a href=http://www.mysql.com>MySQL webpage</a>. For Unix,
a convenient way to configure MySQL, MySQL databases and other servers
can be provided through <a href=http://www.webmin.net>Webmin</a>.
</ul>

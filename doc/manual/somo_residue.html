<p>
This module is used to define all residues that can be found in PDB files. 
In this module, you can also define the rules which are used to convert them
into beads. You can add new residues or modify the properties of the existing
ones. Three panels are available:
<p>
<ol>
<li> <b>Define Residue Properties</b>
<li> <b>Define Residue Atoms</b>
<li> <b>Define Residue Bead Properties</b>
</ol>

<p>
<b>Panel 1: Define Residue Properties:</b>
<p>
<table BORDER CELLSPACING=5 CELLPADDING=5>

<p>In this panel, you can add or modify the general properties of a residue.
To add a new residue, you must first load the <a href="somo-2.png">atom table</a>
containing the atomic groups, as defined in the PDB file (N, CA, CB, etc.),
that make up the residue. <br>The residue name (ALA, GLY, PRO, etc.) is entered
in the <i><b>Residue Name</b></i> field, with a description entered in the <i><b>Description</b></i>
field (this will help in discriminating between entries having the same residue
name in PDB files, but differing by the presence/absence of some atoms, like
the PO<sub>2</sub> group in nucleosides/nucleotides). The <i><b>Number of Atoms in Residue</b></i>
field is then completed (note that only non-hydrogen atoms have to be counted;
for NMR-derived models, hydrogen atoms fields are discarded by the SOMO PDB
parser). <br>The next field, <i><b>Number of Beads for Residue</b></i>, defines how many
beads will be used to represent the residue. For amino acids or nucleic acid
bases, we suggest to use a bead for the main-chain and another for the side-chain
segments, plus one for the PO<sub>2</sub> group in nucleotides. For carbohydrates,
a bead per residue will usually suffice. More complicated entries, like heme or NAD,
must be assigned to a reasonable number of beads taking into account geometric and
chemical considerations. Many entries are already defined in the <i>somo.residue</i>
file distributed with the program.
<br>The <i><b>Residue Type</b></i> field is then defined from the pull-down list,
presently including:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Amino Acid
<li>Sugar Moiety
<li>Nucleotide
<li>Heme
<li>Phosphate
<li>Co-factor
<li>Ion
<li>Detergent
<li>Other
</ul>
<p>
The <i><b>Residue anhydrous mol. vol. (A^3)</b></i> field has to be filled with a 
value usually derived from crystallography (see Tsai et al., J. Mol. Biol.
290:253-266, 1999; Nadassy et al., Nucl. Acid Res. 29:3362-3376, 2001; Voss
and Gerstein, J. Mol. Biol. 346:477-492, 2005; Perkins, Eur. J. Biochem. 
157:169-180, 1986). This is the volume that defines the total anhydrous volume
of the bead(s) that will be used to model the residue, and for non tabulated
entries it can be computed using on-line programs such as the <sup>3</sup>V Contact Volume Calculator (<a href="http://www.molmovdb.org/cgi-bin/3v.cgi">http://www.molmovdb.org/cgi-bin/3v.cgi</a>; a 0
Angstrom probe radius should be used). For ions, we used the values in Table I of
Kiriukhin and Collins (Biophys. Chem. 99:155-168, 2002).
<br>In contrast, the <i><b>Residue partial spec. vol. (cm^3/g)</b></i> field pertains to
the solution partial specific volume (<i>vbar</i>) of the residue (in water @ 20°C),
and is used to compute the global <i>vbar</i> of the model, necessary to determine
the sedimentation coefficient from the translational frictional coefficient. 
Tabulated values are available for amino acids and some carbohydrates (see Perkins,
Eur. J. Biochem. 157:169-180, 1986), or can be computed using the Cohn and Edsall method
(Cohn and Edsall, Proteins, amino acids and peptides as ions and dipolar ions, Reinhold
Publ. Comp., 1965, pp. 370-381; see also Durchschlag and Zipper, Biophys. Chem. 93:
141-157, 2001; Durchschlag and Zipper, J. Appl. Cryst. 30:803-807, 1997; Durchschlag
and Zipper, Prog. Colloid Polym. Sci. 94:20-39, 1994).<br>
For ions, they were mostly computed (<b>April 2012 revision!</b>) from the partial molar volumes (cm<sup>3</sup>/mol) at 25 °C
listed in Table 3 of Durchschlag and Zipper, Prog. Colloid Polym. Sci. 94:20-39, 1994, divided by the molecular weight, and corrected to 20 °C.
For Cd<sup>2+</sup>, which is not present in that table, we used the values derived by Call et al. (J. Chem. Thermodynamics 32:1525-1538, 2000) for 
MgCl<sub>2</sub> and CdCl<sub>2</sub> at 0.35 MPa, after correction to 0.1 MPa by comparing the MgCl<sub>2</sub> value with that reported by
Dunn (Trans. Faraday Soc. 62:2348-2354, 1966). Note that most of these vbar values for the cations are <b>negative</b>!<br> 
Be aware, however, that there's <b>no guarantee</b> that a computed <i>vbar</i> will be correct: the
use of an <b>experimental</b> <i>vbar</i> is <b>strongly</b> recommended!! (see also the
<i>vbar</i> fields in the <a href="somo_misc.html"><i><b>Miscellaneous Options</b></i></a> editor.
<br>Finally, the <i><b>Max. Accessible Surface Area (A^2)</b></i> field is entered. It is
used for control purposes only, to calculate the percentage accessible surface
area (ASA) of each residue with respect to this theoretical maximum value. For
amino acids, it was taken from the tabulated values of Gly-XXX-Gly tripeptides
(Miller et al., J. Mol. Biol. 196:641-656, 1987). For ions, it was computed
from the radius (Table I of Kiriukhin and Collins, Biophys. Chem. 99:155-168, 2002).
For the other entries currently present in the <i>somo.residue</i> file, it was computed
on isolated moieties using the <sup>3</sup>V Contact Volume Calculator (see above) with
a 1.4 A probe radius. 

<p>When all fields have been filled, the residue is accepted by pressing the
<b>Accept Residue and Continue</b> button, and the <i>Number of Residues in File
</i> field is consequently updated.

<p>In this panel, the atoms making up the residue are chosen, using the
<a href="somo-2.png">atom table</a> previously selected. The atoms are numbered
sequentially up to the value entered in the <i><b>Number of Atoms in Residue</b></i>
field in the previous panel, and can be chosen from the <i><b>Select Residue Atom to be defined</b></i>
pull-down menu.
<br>An atom type is then selected from the pull-down menu in the
<i><b>Select Atom from Lookup Table</b></i> menu, and an available hybridization
is then chosen from the <i><b>Select Hybridization for Atom</b></i> pull-down menu 
below it. <br>If the current atom will contribute to the definition of the
position of the bead to which it will be assigned (next panel), the
<i><b>Atom determines Position</b></i> checkbox must be selected. Be aware that in
the default mode operation, the <i><b>SOMO</b></i> method will place the amino acid
main-chain bead using the "<i>peptide bond rule</i>", i.e., it will place the bead at 
the center of gravity between the (CA-C-O)<sub>n</sub> and the (N)<sub>n+1</sub> atoms
(special rules apply when PRO is the (n+1) residue). If the <i>peptide bond rule</i>
is deselected in the <a href="somo_misc.html"><i><b>Miscellaneous Options</b></i></a>
editor, then all the atom positioning rules defined in the <i>somo.residue</i> file
will apply.
<br>The <i><b>Hydration Number for Atom</b></i> field is used to assign an integer
number of water molecules to the current atom. This field was recently introduced
to allow for the direct hydration of a structure for SAXS computations. Currently,
we have assigned directly to atoms only the amino acids hydration values, derived
from the theoretical hydration numbers for entire residues of Kuntz and Kauzmann
(Adv. Protein Chem. 28:239-345, 1974). The global hydration number for each bead in
the residue is subsequently computed by summing up each atom's value. This calculated
global value can be replaced with another value using the <i><b>Override Bead Hydration Value</b></i>
button in the third panel of this editor (see below).
<br>The <b>Assign Current Atom</b> button is then clicked, and the <i><b>Select 
Residue Atom to be defined</b></i> field is then updated.
<br>This operation is repeated until all atoms in the residue have been assigned,
and the <b>Continue</b> button can then be pressed.

<b>Panel 3: Define Residue Bead Properties:</b>

<p>In the last panel of this module, the atoms in each residue are assigned
to bead(s), and each bead's properties are then defined.
<br>According to the value entered in the <i><b>Number of Beads for Residue</b></i>
field in Panel 1, the <i><b>Select Residue Bead to be defined</b></i> pull-down menu
will allow to select a bead from the list. All subsequent operations will affect
the selected bead only.
<br>First a color is assigned to the bead using the <i><b>Select Bead Color</b></i>
pull-down menu. Be aware that two colors are presently reserved to "label"
the beads so that they can be automatically excluded from the hydrodynamic
computations, colors "0" (black) and "6" (brown), so they should NOT be used.
To avoid they inadvertent selection, a Warning pop-up will appear if color "0" or
"6" are chosen, with this message: "Black and brown are reserved colors, please
chose a different color". In addition, we color-code "7" (white) exposed beads
that are fused together, and "8" (grey) beads that were originally labeled as
buried ("6") but are found to be above the exposure threshold upon re-check.
In the <a href="somo-residue-3.png">residue table</a> (an excerpt of the current 
<i>somo.residue</i> is shown) provided with the UltraScan distribution, the colors
are assigned so to label the beads as:
<p>
<ol>
0. - Black: RESERVED, automatically assigned to very small beads (always excluded from computations)
<li>- Blue: protein main-chain
<li>- Green: protein acidic side-chain (D,E)
<li>- Cyan: protein hydrophobic side-chain (A,V,L,I,F,W)
<li>- Red: protein polar side-chain (H,Y,S,T,N,Q)
<li>- Magenta: protein non-polar side-chain (C,M,P)
<li>- Brown: RESERVED for buried beads (automatically assigned during model generation)
<li>- White: USED for fused beads
<li>- Grey: USED for previously buried beads found to be exposed on re-check
<li>- Light Blue: lipids tails, carbon monoxide
<li>- Light Green: USED by the Automatic Bead Builder for non-coded residues (see <a
href=somo_pdb_parsing.html>here</a>)
<li>- Light Cyan: bases in DNA/RNA, oxygen, 13P
<li>- Light Red: heme, NAD, other co-factors, some prosthetic groups and ions, PO<sub>2</sub>, lipids heads
<li>- Light Magenta: carbohydrates (including sugar rings in nucleotides), some ions
<li>- Yellow: protein basic side-chain (K,R)
<li>- Bright White: unassigned
</ol>
<p> 

<br>Next comes the <i><b>Select Positioning Method</b></i> field, offering three
options:
<p><i>Center of gravity</i>: between the atoms assigned to the bead and marked
"yes" in the <i><b>Atom determines Position</b></i> checkbox in Panel 2;
<br><i>Farthest atom</i>: from the center of gravity of the molecule, again
between the atoms assigned to the bead and marked "yes" in the
<i><b>Atom determines Position</b></i> checkbox in Panel 2;
<br><i>No positioning</i>: to exclude the bead from the model.
<br>Currently, only the <i>Center of gravity</i> option is being used.
<p>Each bead needs then to be defined as belonging to the <i>backbone</i>
or to the <i>sidechain</i> of the molecule by clicking the appropriate box
in the <i><b>This Bead is part of the:</b></i> field. This determines at which sequential stage the bead
will be processed during overlap removal in the <i>SoMo</i> method.
<p>
The next step is the assignment of atoms to the bead. In the <i><b>Select Atom
for Bead (multi-selection OK)</b></i> window, you can see the list of all the atoms
that belong to the residue, as defined previously in Panel 2. By clicking on
an atom, it will be also displayed in the <i><b>Currently defined Atoms for Bead</b></i>
window to the left. Once all atoms belonging to a bead have been selected, the
bead is accepted by clicking on the <b>Accept Bead Definition</b> button.
<p>
The <i><b>Bead Volume</b></i> field defines the anhydrous volume (in A<sup>3</sup>) assigned
to the bead. IMPORTANT: the sum of the volumes of the bead(s) defining a residue
MUST match the <i><b>Residue anhydrous mol. vol.</b></i> entered in Panel 1. The
program will NOT let you save the residue/bead definition if there is a
discrepancy between these two values. The values present in the current
definitions of the amino acid residues were derived from the crystallographic
analysis (see above for references). When a molecule needs to be subdived in more
than one bead, the volumes of the various parts can be determined using the
<sup>3</sup>V Contact Volume Calculator (see above). However, the parts' volumes
will NOT add up to the entire molecule volume, and MUST be then proportionally
rescaled. The volume of all other entries in the current <i>somo.residue</i> table
were determined in this way.
<p>
The next field, <i><b>Bead Mol. Weight</b></i> is for visualization only,
and will display the bead molecular weight, calculated from the values (taken from the <a href=
"somo-2.png">atom table</a>).
<p>
Likewise, the subsequent field, <i><b>Bead Hydration from Atoms' Values</b></i>, will show 
the theoretical number of water of hydration molecules assigned to the bead, based on the
sum of the atoms' values entered in <b>Panel 2</b>. However, since the atomic values
are likely not defined for most residues, a global value for each bead can be entered in
the next field, <i><b>Override Bead Hydration Value</b></i>. Most beads' values currently
present in the <i>somo.residue</i> file were derived from literature. For carbohydrates,
we used the values of  Shiio (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 80:70-73, 1958). For ions, we used the
values in Table I of Kiriukhin and Collins (Biophys. Chem. 99:155-168, 2002).
For the other residues, and for further information, see Brookes et al., Eur. Biophys. J.
in press, 2009, and Rai et al., Structure 13:723-734, 2005. The volume of 
these water molecule(s) (defined under the <b>Miscellaneous Options</b>;
see <a href=somo_misc.html>here</a>) will be later automatically added to the
anhydrous volume of the bead to define its hydrated volume and radius.
<p>
Finally, in the last field, <i><b> Bead hydrated Volume, Radius</b></i>, is again for
visualization only, and will display the bead's hydrated molecular volume and hydrated radius
(derived by summing to the anhydrous  <i><b>Bead Volume</b></i> the volume of the water of
hydration molecules, see above).

<p>If the residue is represented by more than one bead, the process is repeated
until all beads have been processed.

<p> The residue can then be added to the file by clicking on the <b>Add Residue to File</b> 
button. If the beads' anhydrous volumes sum doesn't match the residue's anhydrous volume as entered
in the first section, a pop-up window will appear warning of the problem and prompting to either accept
the current bead volumes values, or for corrective action to be taken.<br>
The process can be interrupted at any stage by pressing the <b>Reset</b> button.

<p>To Edit an already defined residue, double-click on its name on the list
(that can be scrolled) present in the window next to the <i><b>Number of residues in
File</b></i> field in Panel 1. All the stored properties will then appear
first in the Panel 1 fields, which can then be updated. By clicking on the
<b>Accept Residue and Continue</b> button, the properties listed in Panel 2
become then accessible, and can be likewise edited. Finally, the Panel 3
options will become again available for editing by clicking on the
<b>Continue</b> button in Panel 2. <b>Accept Bead Definition</b>
and <b>Add Residue to File</b> buttoms will then allow to update the
<a href="somo-residue-3.png">residue table</a> (<i>somo.residue</i>).
<br>A selected residue/bead definition can be also removed from the file by
clicking on the <b>Delete Residue</b> button.
<br>Pressing <b>Close</b> will then exit from the <b>Modify Residue Lookup 
Tables</b> menu and return the operator to the <b>Main menu</b>.

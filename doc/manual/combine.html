<H2>Combining G(s) distributions:</H2>
<p>
<CENTER><img src="combine1.png"></CENTER>


<p>To combine integral van Holde - Weischet G(s) distributions from
multiple datasets (either from different cells of the same run or from
different runs), use the "Combine Distribution Plots" item from the <A
HREF="menu_utilities0.png">Utilities</A> menu. This will allow you to compare
integral distributions from different cells to each other.  This may
be useful if you analyzed the same sample under different conditions,
for example, different pH levels or different concentrations. If the
samples are the same, the distributions should overlay, if the samples
behave differently, the distributions will be shifted against each other.

<p>All distributions will be plotted relative to the boundary fraction
they were analyzed. For example, if you analyzed 100% of the boundary,
the distribution will range from 0 % - 100 % of the Y-axis. A distribution
that was analyzed from 72 % of the boundary, shifted 8 % from the bottom
will be plotted from 8 % to 80 % of the Y-axis. It is important that this
distinction be made, since, for example, concentration dependent samples
will behave differently depending on the position in the boundary, or heterogeneous
samples will show different distributions depending which portion of the
boundary was analyzed.
<p>
You can remove erroneously added distributions by double clicking
on the distribution to remove it. The curve will be highlighted in <a
href=combine6.png>white</a> and a <a href=combine7.png>message window</a>
will ask you if you want to delete it. Confirm or cancel.

<td>Click on these buttons to control the van Holde - Weischet analysis.
<UL>
<li>
<b>Load Data:</b> Load edited data sets (with the *.us suffix). A
<a href=load_sed.png>file dialogue</a> will allow you to select
a previously edited and saved velocity experiment. If the data was
edited with a version of UltraScan less than the current version, an <a
href=version.png>error message</a> will be displayed.

<li>
<b>Run Details:</b> View the <A HREF="run_details_veloc.png">diagnostic details</A>
for a particular run.

<li>
<b>Print Data:</b> Load the printer control panel for printing of plot
graphics

<li>
<b>Save Data:</b> Write out a copy of all distributiones to an ASCII formatted
data file suitable for import into a spreadsheet plotting program. The
data will be saved in a file called "distrib.dat" in your results directory
(see <A HREF="config.html">configuration panel</A>). See "<A HREF="file_format.html">File
Structures and Formats</A>" for details. The descriptions in the legend
for each dataset is saved in an ASCII file called "distrib.txt". Note:
These files are overwritten each time this button is clicked. Only the
last version of the analysis will be saved!

<li>
<b>Help:</b> This help file

<li>
<b>Close:</b> Close the "Combine G(s) Distribution" window.

<li>
<b>Reset:</b> Reset the plot window and delete all distributions and the
legend. After clicking on "Reset" you can start with a new, empty plot
window.

<li>
<b>Distribution Name:</b> The name under which the html report will
be saved.  If you make this name the same as the dataset, the
combined distribution data will be included in the html report for
that dataset. If the default name "distribution" is left unchanged,
a separate directory called "distribution" will be created under the
html report directory. For more information on the html reports, please
see the <a href=html_report.html>html report</a> manual page.

<p><b>Plot Distribution Selection:</b>

<table BORDER CELLSPACING=5 CELLPADDING=5 bgcolor="#FFFFFF" NOSAVE >

<td><img src="combine12.png"></td>

Select the distribution type to be displayed in the plot. You can overlay different
types of plots (<a href=combine1.png>integral distribution</a> or 
<a href=combine1a.png>histogram envelope</a> or <a href=combine1b.png>both</a>) or overlay 
different distributions. When you click on the checkboxes, the next distribution to
be added will be displayed in the format identified by the selected checkbox. The default setting is the integral van Holde - Weischet distribution.

<p><b>Experimental Parameters:</b>

<table BORDER CELLSPACING=5 CELLPADDING=5 bgcolor="#FFFFFF" NOSAVE >
<tr>
<td><img src="combine4.png"></td>

<td>Single-clicking on a cell or wavelength will bring up the sample
description of that cell and wavelength. If no data is available for your
selection, it will be indicated in the top field. Double-clicking on a
valid selection will add the integral distribution of that selection to
the plot area and add an item to the legend. Scroll through this list
to bring up information for cells > 3. If you double-click on an invalid
item, an <A HREF="combine8.png"> error message window</A> will appear. If
the selection is valid, but a distribution plot has not been saved
from the van Holde - Weischet analysis, an <A HREF="combine9.png">error
message</A> will appear.
<p>
If you decide to eliminate a distribution plot from the combined 
overlay, simply click on the scan to be removed in the plot area, and 
you will be asked if you want to delete the highlighted scan. The scan
about to be deleted will be highlighted in white.</td>

<td>Sometimes the legend does not appear correctly resized (for example,
if the item in the description of the sample is too long for the provided
screen area), In that case, it is necessary to resize the window to a larger
size to accommodate the longer text. Click on "<A HREF="combine10.png">Zoom
in</A>" or "<A HREF="combine11.png">Zoom out</A>" to present a smaller or
larger scale of the item. Clicking on the X-min and X-max counters allows
you to manually set the X-min/max limits of the data plot.</td>

<H2>Archive Manager Utility:</H2>
<p>
<CENTER><img src="archive-1.png"></CENTER>


<p>The Archive Manager utility can be invoked by clicking on the <A
HREF="menu_utilities0.png">"Archive Manager"</A> entry in the Utility Menu
from the Main Menu of <b><I>UltraScan</I></b> (<b>Note:</b> The archive
utility is not available on all platforms). The purpose of this module
is to provide a simple interface to managing large number of related
data files in big analysis projects by providing an archiving utility
that allows you to group files together in a single compressed data
archive. These single files are then easily transferred to a different
computer and maintain complete portability across different workstations.
As a side benefit, disk usage is reduced.

<p>
The user also may want to archive data on CDROM, and this utility allows
you to generate single-file data archives for inclusion into CDROM archives.

<b><FONT SIZE=+1>Explanation of Functions:</FONT></b>
<p>
<b>Viewing an Archive:</b>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5>
<tr>
	<td rowspan=2>
		<img src=archive-2.png>
	</td>
	<td>
		<li><b>View Archive</b>
	</td>
	<td>
		Load an existing archive from the archive directory (see
		<a href=config.html>Ultrascan Configuration</a> for details)
		and view the contents. There can be up to three sub-archives
		in each main archive representing different groups of 
		related data files (see Archive Creation, below). When
		viewing an archive, all available sub-archives will be 
		shown in the report window, as will be the filename, the 
		size of the archive, the compression ratio and the amount
		of diskspace needed to extract the archive. The program will
		also compute the amount of diskspace available to the user
		on the filesystem that has been configured for the export of
		the data. It is assumed that the data will be restored to
		the same filesystem as the configured data directory. If
		the available diskspace is not sufficient for extraction,
		a warning message will be printed and the user will be alerted
		to free up some diskspace before proceeding to extract the 
		archive.

<b>Archive Creation:</b>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5>
<tr>
	<td rowspan=9>
		<img src=archive-3.png>
	</td>
	<td>
		<li><b>Include UltraScan Data</b>
	</td>
	<td>
		If selected, edited data stored in the UltraScan Results 
		directory will be included in the archive. This data may
		not be always portable across different architectures, since
		different hardware address binary data in different ways.
		All other files archived will always be portable, even across
		different hardware architectures. In the worst case, you will
		have to re-edit and re-analyze the experimental data if 
		unpacked on a different architecture. This button is selected
		by default. Raw experimental data will always be added to an
		archive, regardless of settings.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>
		<li><b>Include html Reports</b>
	</td>
	<td>
		If selected, the archive manager will archive html
		reports, if present, from the report directory associated
		with the run name. This option is selected by default, and
		this data will be added to the archive in addition to UltraScan
		data, if selected and the raw experimental data, which will
		always be added to the archive by default.
	</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>
		<li><b>Delete Original Data</b>
	</td>
	<td>
		If selected, the archive manager will delete all source files
		after creation of the archive in order to conserve diskspace.
		This includes the deletion of original raw experimental data
		files, which will always be added to the archive by default.
		This button is also selected by default.

</tr>
<tr>
	<td>
		<li><b>Select Velocity Data</b>
	</td>
	<td>
		Use this button to obtain a filedialog for selecting an
		edited velocity data set.

		<li><b>Select Equilibrium Data</b>
	</td>
	<td>
		Use this button to obtain a filedialog for selecting an
		edited equilibrium data set.

	<td>
		Use this button to obtain a filedialog for selecting an
		Equilibrium Fitting Project.

		<li><b>Select Monte Carlo Project</b>
	</td>

		Use this button to obtain a filedialog for selecting a
		Monte Carlo analysis.

	<td>
		This field shows the name of the archive about to be 
		created.

</tr>
<tr>
	<td>
		<li><b>Create Archive</b>
	</td>
	<td>
		Go ahead and create an archive from the selected data. The
		archive creation process can be followed in the report
		window. Compression of the archive will proceed in the 
		background and allow you to resume with other work. Depending
		on archive size and processor speed, the compression of the 
		archive may take several minutes.

<b>Extracting an Archive:</b>

		<li><b>Extract Archive</b>
	</td>
	<td>
		Click here to select an archive for extraction. An error will
		be generated if you are still compressing the archive to be
		extracted in the background. In that case, just wait for a 
		few minutes until the compression has completed (monitor
		with the Unix "top" command).

<H2>Combining C(s) distributions:</H2>
<p>
<CENTER><img src="combine_cofs1.png"></CENTER>


<p>This program enables you to combine multiple sedimentation coefficient
distributions from the C(s) analysis into a single plot.
You can combine multiple datasets (either from different cells of the
same run or from different runs) by using the "Combine C(s)
Distributions" item from the <A HREF="menu_utilities0.png">Utilities</A>
menu. This will allow you to compare molecular weight distributions
(which are derived from integral distributions) from different runs
and different cells to each other.  This may be useful if you analyzed
the same sample under different conditions, for example, different
pH levels or different concentrations. If the samples are the same,
the distributions should overlay, if the samples behave differently,
the distributions will be shifted against each other.
<p>
<font color=red><b>Important Note:</b> The C(s) analysis can produce
misleading results and artifactual peaks under certain conditions. If
the f/f0 ratio is overestimated, additional artifactual peaks can occur.
<p>
Example:
</font>
<table border=1 cellpadding=10>
<tr>
<td><img src=combine_cofs3.png></td>
<td>f/f0=1.2 (appropriate for first peak and corresponding to the true
C(s) distribution as verfified by van Holde - Weischet and finite element analysis)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src=combine_cofs4.png></td>
<td>f/f0=3.1 (appropriate for second peak)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><img src=combine_cofs5.png></td>
<td>f/f0=3.1 (appropriate for second peak)</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
<font color=red><b>Important Note:</b> In addition to uncertainties about
multiple peaks in the distribution, there is another problem users of the
C(s) analysis need to be aware of: The molecular weight and diffusion
coefficient distributions generated by the C(s) method are based on a
single f/f0 value either set or fitted in the C(s) analysis, and on a
single vbar value identified with this run.  If either the vbar or the
f/f0 value is incorrect, the molecular weight and diffusion coefficient
distributions will also be incorrect. In general, it is unlikely that
multiple components in a single experiment will have the same f/f0
value. This unlikelyhood is translated into the reliability of these
distribution. If only a single component is visible in the distribution
it is more likely that the value determined for f/f0 is correct.</font>

<p>
You can remove erroneously added distributions by double clicking
on the distribution to remove it. The curve will be highlighted in <a
href=combine_cofs2.png>white</a> and a <a href=combine7.png>message window</a>
will ask you if you want to delete it. Confirm or cancel.

<td>Click on these buttons to control the van Holde - Weischet analysis.
<UL>
<li>
<b>Load Data:</b> Load edited data sets (with the *.us suffix). A
<a href=load_sed.png>file dialogue</a> will allow you to select
a previously edited and saved velocity experiment. If the data was
edited with a version of UltraScan less than the current version, an <a
href=version.png>error message</a> will be displayed.

<li>
<b>Run Details:</b> View the <A HREF="run_details_veloc.png">diagnostic details</A>
for a particular run.

<li>
<b>Print Data:</b> Load the printer control panel for printing of plot
graphics

<li>
<b>Save Data:</b> Write out a copy of all distributiones to an ASCII formatted
data file suitable for import into a spreadsheet plotting program. The
data will be saved in a file called "cofs_distrib.dat" in your results directory
(see <A HREF="config.html">configuration panel</A>). See "<A HREF="file_format.html">File
Structures and Formats</A>" for details. The descriptions in the legend
for each dataset is saved in an ASCII file called "cofs_distrib.txt". Note:
These files are overwritten each time this button is clicked. Only the
last version of the analysis will be saved! You can associate the distribution
file by giving it the same name as the run to whose report you would like to add
the distribution information. Then the data will be saved in the report directory
with the name of the run. This way you can avoid overwriting distribution files.

<li>
<b>Help:</b> This help file

<li>
<b>Close:</b> Close the "Combine C(s) Distribution" window.

<li>
<b>Reset:</b> Reset the plot window and delete all distributions and the
legend. After clicking on "Reset" you can start with a new, empty plot
window.

that dataset. If the default name "distribution" is left unchanged,
a separate directory called "distribution" will be created under the

<td>Single-clicking on a cell or wavelength will bring up the sample
description of that cell and wavelength. If no data is available for your
selection, it will be indicated in the top field. Double-clicking on a
valid selection will add the integral distribution of that selection to
the plot area and add an item to the legend. Scroll through this list
to bring up information for cells > 3. If you double-click on an invalid
item, an <A HREF="combine8.png"> error message window</A> will appear. If
the selection is valid, but a distribution plot has not been saved
from the van Holde - Weischet analysis, an <A HREF="combine9.png">error
message</A> will appear.
<p>
If you decide to eliminate a distribution plot from the combined 
overlay, simply click on the scan to be removed in the plot area, and 
you will be asked if you want to delete the highlighted scan. The scan
about to be deleted will be highlighted in white.</td>

<td>Sometimes the legend does not appear correctly resized (for example,
if the item in the description of the sample is too long for the provided
screen area), In that case, it is necessary to resize the window to a larger
size to accommodate the longer text. Click on "<A HREF="combine10.png">Zoom
in</A>" or "<A HREF="combine11.png">Zoom out</A>" to present a smaller or
larger scale of the item. Clicking on the X-min and X-max counters allows
you to manually set the X-min/max limits of the data plot.</td>

<h2>Customizing and generating Publication-Quality Graphs of all UltraScan Plots:</h2>
<p>
The QWT C++ plotting library, on which <i><b>UltraScan</b></i> is based,
and which is distributed with <i><b>UltraScan</b></i>, provides a powerful
feature for editing all plot properties such as line and symbol type,
color, size, etc. as well as plot layout, title and label fonts, and
the axis properties. To invoke the plot configuration for any plot
generated under <i><b>UltraScan</b></i>, simply right-click on the
plot frame. This will open up the main plot customization panel:

<p>
In the window entitled <b>"Title Elements"</b> you can modify the text
of the plot title and change the font using the <a href=usfont-2.png>font
selection panel</a>. The next window is entitled <b>"Curve Elements"</b>
and will list all curves displayed in the current plot. The curves are
displayed by their name and number of appearance in the plot. You can
simply click on the curve you want to change or select multipl curves (if
multiple curves are displayed) to change all to the same properties. After
selecting the desired curves, click on <b>"Update Selected Curve..."</b>
to change the curve(s) properties. You will then be presented with the 
curve property control panel:

<p>
Select the desired curve properties from the drop-down lists, which include
several predefined options, as well as the <b>"Customize"</b> option, which 
lets you set custom selections for colors. You can also edit the curve's
description. Please not that different curves may have the same description, 
which may be best avoided to prevent confusion.
<p>
Last, you can modify the plot elements such as background color, margin,
legend position and font, as well as axis properties. The axis properties are
shown in the axis control panel:

<h2>AccessGrid Seminar for UltraScan</h2>
<p align=justify>
The AccessGrid Seminar for UltraScan is a forum for UltraScan users to meet virtually
on the Internet through AccessGrid video conferencing. The purpose of this monthly seminar
is to discuss program features, analyze data, discuss problems and questions and meet
with the developer.
<p align=justify>
All meetings are at the UTHSCSA Bioinformatics Venue Service in the CAUMA room:
<p align=justify>
Venue Service Address: https://ag1.v19.uthscsa.edu:8000/Venues/default
<p align=justify>
The time for all meetings will be 11:00 am - 12:00 noon US
Central Time. (Westcoast -2, East coast +1, England +6, rest
of western Europe +7).  There will be 1 hour setup time for testing
before the seminar. Please contact Jeremy Mann (210-567-2672, <a
href=mailto:jeremy@biochem.uthscsa.edu>jeremy@biochem.uthscsa.edu</a>) if
you have questions/problems with your connection.  If needed, additional
time can be scheduled after the meeting. More information about the AccessGrid,
incl. software, hardware recommendations, and setup instructions can be found
at <a href=http://www.accessgrid.uthscsa.edu>http://www.accessgrid.uthscsa.edu</a>

<p align=justify>
If you would like me to analyze some of your data during these seminars, please
contact me directly a few days before the meeting and send me your data as a 
zip or tar.gz archive to: <a href=mailto:demeler@biochem.uthscsa.edu>demeler@biochem.uthscsa.edu</a>.

<li><p align=justify><b>May 5th, 2005:<br>Presenter:</b> Borries Demeler, UTHSCSA, Dept. of Biochemistry
.
<br><b>Topic:</b> In this seminar I will follow up on a suggestion by Karel 
Planken, to analyze sedimentation velocity data with various methods and highlight
what can be learned from each. We will look at van Holde - Weischet, C(s), 
second moment, finite element fitting, and dc/dt. If you would like to submit
some data for this seminar, please do so in advance by e-mailing me a zip or
tar.gz archive of the directory containing your data. 1 dataset per participant, please.

<li><b>April 7th, 2005:<br>Presenter:</b> Borries Demeler, UTHSCSA, Dept. of Biochemistry
.
<br><b>Topic:</b> In this seminar I will discuss the genetic algorithm work
we have been developing. This is a promising new method designed to obtain
high-resolution molecular weight distributions from sedimentation velocity
experiments. I will expand on the talk given at the 14th intl. AUC conference
in Lausanne, Switzerland.

<li><b>March 2005:<br> <font color=red>No Meeting</font></b> (I will be attending the <a href=http://isic.epfl.ch/auc2005> 14th International Symposium on Analytical Ultracentrifugation</a>)
<li>
<p align=justify>
<b>February 3rd, 2005:<br>Presenter:</b> Borries Demeler, UTHSCSA, Dept. of Biochemistry.
<br><b>Topic:</b> In this seminar I will demonstrate the new C(s) implementation 
in UltraScan. I will show the program and discuss the options. The demonstration
will include analysis of real and simulated data. Analysis results are compared
to van Holde - Weischet analyses.
<p align=justify>
<li><b>January 6th, 2005:<br>Presenter:</b> Borries Demeler, UTHSCSA, Dept. of Biochemistry.
<br><b>Topic:</b> This meeting will be a free for all. You can upload your data to the 
AccessGrid and I will edit & analyze it while you watch. I will answer any questions and
discuss ways to improve your data (if applicable, of course) and discuss experimental
design issues. You should have your data available in tar.gz or zip archive form (a single
file for all raw data). If you already edited your data using UltraScan then you can 
use the archive feature of UltraScan to create an UltraScan archive.
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>December 2nd, 2004:<br>Presenter:</b> Borries Demeler, UTHSCSA, Dept. of Biochemistry.
<br><b>Topic:</b> An overview of the new UltraScan LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System),
the UltraScan hydrodynamic database and UltraScan and web interfaces for this system. This system
is designed to aid in the management of data, result presentation, and coordination of 
multi-user/investigator facilities. I will discuss how the investigators can provide
information over a web interface, and review their data and analysis results from UltraScan
over the web, and interface with a relational database from both UltraScan and from the 
web interface.

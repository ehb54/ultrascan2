<a NAME="whatis"></a>What is <b><i>UltraScan</i></b>?
<p><b><i>UltraScan</i></b> attempts to be a comprehensive data analysis
tool for the hydrodynamic studies of macromolecules and macromolecular
assemblies with analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. 
The main goal of <b><i>UltraScan</i></b>
is to provide an intuitive GUI which provides an integrated data editing
and analysis environment. The software utilizes fast and highly efficient
analysis algorithms that are easily applied. The software should be useful
to the non-expert technician with little training in the field, as well
as provide an efficient interface to the experienced user who has to analyze
a large amount of data in the shortest possible time. To achieve this goal,
every possible task that can be automated is implemented in the software
and only tasks that can not be predicted a priori are left to the user.
This is always a difficult goal to attain, since the software will need
many diagnostics and error checks to assure the user is not overwhelmed
and led to incorrect data interpretations. Therefore, extra care has been
taken in the design of this software to assure that incorrect user actions
are caught by the software and clearly indicated. Similarly, warnings will
be provided to assist the user in correct result interpretation. Over time,
I will attempt to include the majority of published methods as modules
that can be used in this integrated data analysis environment.

<p>
<li>
<a NAME="howtostart"></a>I got an XL-A, I want Unix-based <b><i>UltraScan</i></b>,
what should I do?
<p>
Since Unix-based <b><i>UltraScan</i></b> requires Unix to run, and Beckman's
data acquisition software requires Microsoft Windows, 
you will have to install a second operating system. You will not be able
to concurrently run 2 different operating systems on the same hardware,
so you either need two separate computers, or you'll have to install 
two operating systems on the same PC. So, you have two options:
<p>
1. You can install Linux on the XL-A computer that came with the XL-A/I.
In most cases, that requires freeing up a minimum of 2 GB of diskspace
for a Linux partition, configuring your PC as a dual-boot system, so you
can run both Linux and Windows on the same system.
If diskspace is low, a second drive is easily added to the computer that
can accommodate Linux, and, because of the low cost of harddrives today,
you'll probably end up getting a big drive.
The disadvantage
of this setup is that you can never run the XL-A data collection simultanousely
with the 
<b><i>UltraScan</i></b> software, because each task requires a different 
operating system.
<p>
2. You can install <b><i>UltraScan</i></b> and Linux on a second PC,
network both PC's over ethernet.
The computer can aquire data and work just fine if you add an ethernet network interface
card) and you can analyze data <b><i>while</i></b> aquiring it on the XL-A
PC. This is the <b><i>preferred</i></b>
method. Of course, you could also leave the computers without network connectivity
and transfer files using a floppy disk, CD or tape. 
Linux
runs happily on all Intel, Mac-PPC and Sparc hardware.
You probably
have an old Pentium laying around, why not add some memory, install Linux and
you have a decent workstation for AUC data analysis. Also see section "<a href="#hardware">Hardware
required</a>".
<p>The last obstacle you may have to overcome is your fear of Unix. This
is unfounded. Although Unix is quite a bit more sophisticated and complex
than Windows, most distributions now available come with excellent installation
programs that make installation a breeze and hide the complexity behind
well-written installation and GUI configuration software that'll get you
going in no time. In addition, they come with good reference manuals and
excellent documentation, written for converting beginners. Your local bookstore
may also have some good reference books on Linux that are worthwhile to
keep around.

<p><a href="#top"><img src=graphics/top.gif> Back to Top</a>
<p>
<li>
<a NAME="help"></a>I need help installing Linux (Unix, FreeBSD, etc.)</li>
<p>Linux comes with excellent documentation. Try contacting a local Linux
User Group (LUG) for assistance.
<p><a href="#top"><img src=graphics/top.gif> Back to Top</a>
<p>
<li>
<a NAME="kernel"></a>What Linux kernel do I need?</li>
<p>Any Linux kernel from the 2.4.20 on upwards can be used for the Linux version
of UltraScan. A recent 2.6 based Linux kernel is recommended.
<p><a href="#top"><img src=graphics/top.gif> Back to Top</a>
<p>
<li>
<a NAME="distribution"></a>What Linux distribution should I use?</li>
<p>All Linux distributions known to us are supported.
Any current version of Gentoo, Ubuntu, RedHat, Slackware, S.u.S.e, Mandrake or
Debian can be recommended. All Linux versions are available for free
by downloading from the Internet or by purchase through a commercial outfit
such as <a href="http://www.linuxmall.com">Linux Mall</a> for a few dollars
to cover the costs of burning the CD. We also offer our own distribution, 
which comes pre-installed with <b><i>UltraScan</i></b>. This distribution 
is based on Slackware, and is distributed as an iso image, which can be burnt
to CDROM or DVD and creates a bootable disk for installation.
<p><a href="#top"><img src=graphics/top.gif> Back to Top</a>
<p>
<li>
<a NAME="dual"></a>Can <b><i>UltraScan</i></b> take advantage of my dual
Pentium motherboard?</li>
<p>Yes, any multiprocessor and multicore SMP motherboards are 
supported by Linux. SMP capability is utilized through threading in the nonlinear least
squares fitting algorithms, the Monte Carlo analysis, and many utilities.
<p>
<p><a href="#top"><img src=graphics/top.gif> Back to Top</a>
<li>
<a NAME="smp"></a>Is parallel processing possible for finite-element calculations?</li>
<p>Yes, see above.
<p><a href="#top"><img src=graphics/top.gif> Back to Top</a>
<p>
<li>
<a NAME="other_unix"></a>Can I run <b><i>UltraScan </i></b>on my Unix Workstation
(SGI, Dec Alpha, Solaris, HPUX, AIX, etc...)</li>
<p>If you can't find your particular hardware distribution available on
the <a href="download.html">download page</a>, contact me and I may be
able to provide you with a port.
<p><a href="#top"><img src=graphics/top.gif> Back to Top</a>
<p>
<li>
<a NAME="fonts"></a>
I am running UltraScan on an SGI/DEC Alpha and all
the fonts look too large for the text fields of
UltraScan - how can I fix this?<p>
You need to adjust the fontpath to make sure that the 75 dpi fonts are
loaded by default first. Please check <a href=SGIfonts.html>here</a> for
detailed instructions. You can also adjust the fonts in File:Configuration:Fonts
<p>
<a href="#top"><img src=graphics/top.gif> Back to Top</a>
<p>
<li>
<a NAME="beowulf"></a>The Beowulf Monte Carlo doesn't work - what's wrong?</li>
<p>
This is most likely due to 2 issues: First check to make sure that you
can log into the remote beowulf nodes without a password using either rsh
or ssh. In an insecure environment, ssh is the preferred method, then you
would have to generate a public key and add it to your own authorized_keys
files. This works well on an nfs-shared /home directory across the cluster.
On a secure Beowulf you can use rsh, in which case you need to have rshd
running with the appropriate flags, and also have installed an ~/.rhosts
file with entries of all your nodes and authorized usernames. Please see
the documentation for your specific Unix flavor for ssh and rsh for more
details. The second issue is generally due to failed environment 
initializations. On linux, running bash, these have to be done in 
~/.bashrc, not ~/.bash_login. Do not forget to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
variable for Qt, QWT and the UltraScan library (for dynamic installations).
The system directory also needs to be defined in the UltraScan configuration.

These are the steps to update a 7.x version database to 9.x+:

The new table is called tblRawExpData
It needs to be created by hand in the new database

It can be copied from $ULTRASCAN/etc/mysql.dll

execute the MySQL command
change the default database to the one that needs to be upgraded in the 
configuration widget.
go into $ULTRASCAN/develop/us_db_convert
make sure there is no $HOME/us/data/temp directory, so rm -r  $HOME/us/data/temp
run us_db_convert

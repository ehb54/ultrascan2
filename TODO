Change vbar for each solute in fematch and replot with memorized vbar
allow other methods to be used without requirement for uniform grid between sa2d saves
Database:
select user first in database portal, then all experimental data.
add "search by investigator" to result dialogs
add "investigator preselected" to vbar dialog in extinction fitter
make "experiment", not "project request" be the default.
Allow editing/reviewing of project requests
integrate Josh's code



centerpiece/rotor database measurements and calibration utility

when loading database exp. data and target dir already exists, and a 
different exp. is selected, the error directory string doesn't change from
the first exp. and the error persists.

see all your data, but don't include in your fit (masking bit for fitted data)

parallelization of finite element.

add database support for data analysis results and generate web pages 
from database

Implement archive program with QProcess for processing stdout of tar, find win32 tar

The following programs should use result_flag from US_DB, which still needs to
be implemented:
us_dtactrl.cpp:         int result_flag = buffer_db_dlg->db_connect();
us_globalequil.cpp:                     int result_flag = buffer_db_dlg->db_connect();

when querying experimental data, just search the index fields, and dont require
downloading the entire database

New Grant:
create code documentation with doxygen
develop realtime online data analysis modules
develop multi-wavelength/fluorescence scanning data import
develop hetero-association models for multi-wavelength surfaces
develop overlays of exp. data and simulated data to see in which direction
the exp. data goes. Overlaying allows direct comparison to simulated data
to decide if the protein is less or more than the simulation.
develop adaptive mesh FEM for velocity
develop numerical jacobian calculation for FEM
develop multi-threaded FEM solutions
